# SQL Basics

- SELECT: Is used to select data from a database
~~~sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;

SELECT cus.CustomerName,cus.City, cus.PostalCode FROM Customers AS cus;
~~~

- SELECT DISTINCT: Is used to return only distinct (different) values
~~~sql
SELECT Country FROM Customers;
SELECT COUNT(Country) FROM Customers;

SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;

SELECT Count(*) AS DistinctCountries
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);
~~~

- WHERE: Is used to filter records
~~~sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country is 'Mexico';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country is not 'Mexico';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName like '%Alfre%'

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City IN ('Paris','London');

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 40 AND 60;
~~~

- AND, OR and NOT Operators
    - The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE
    - The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE
~~~sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany' AND City='Berlin';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City='Berlin' OR City='MÃ¼nchen';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country='Germany';
~~~

- ORDER BY: Is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order
~~~sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY City DESC;

SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY City;

SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY ContactName,CustomerID;
~~~

- INSERT INTO: Is used to insert new records in a table
~~~sql
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');
~~~

- NULL values
~~~sql
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address
FROM Customers
WHERE Address IS NULL;

SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address
FROM Customers
WHERE Address IS NOT NULL;
~~~

- UPDATE: Is used to modify the existing records in a table
~~~sql
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;

UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName='Juan'
WHERE Country='Mexico';
~~~

- Be careful when updating records. If you omit the WHERE clause, ALL records will be updated!
~~~sql
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName='Juan';
~~~

- DELETE: Is used to delete existing records in a table
~~~sql
DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';

DELETE FROM Customers;
~~~
 
- SELECT TOP: Is used to specify the number of records to return
- Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM
~~~sql
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;

SELECT * FROM Customers
LIMIT 3;

SELECT * FROM Customers
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;

SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
LIMIT 3;

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
~~~

- MIN() and MAX() 
    - The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column
    - The MAX() function returns the largest value of the selected column
~~~sql
SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice
FROM Products;

SELECT MAX(Price) AS LargestPrice
FROM Products;
~~~

- COUNT(), AVG() and SUM()
    - COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion
    - AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column
    - SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column
~~~sql
SELECT COUNT(ProductID)
FROM Products;

SELECT AVG(Price)
FROM Products;

SELECT SUM(Quantity)
FROM OrderDetails;
~~~

- LIKE: Is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column
~~~sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'b_o%s';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName NOT LIKE 'a%';
~~~

- Wildcards
    - \*	Represents zero or more characters	
    - ?	    Represents a single character	
    - []	Represents any single character within the brackets	
    - !	    Represents any character not in the brackets	
    - \-	Represents any single character within the specified range	
    - \#	Represents any single numeric character
    
~~~sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE 'ber%';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '%es%';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[bsp]%';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '[!bsp]%';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City NOT LIKE '[bsp]%';
~~~

- IN Operator 
    - Allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause
    - Is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions
~~~sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country IN (SELECT Country FROM Suppliers);
~~~

- BETWEEN 
    - Selects values within a given range
~~~sql
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20
AND CategoryID NOT IN (1,2,3);

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductName BETWEEN 'Carnarvon Tigers' AND 'Mozzarella di Giovanni'
ORDER BY ProductName;

SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '1996-07-01' AND '1996-07-31';
~~~

- Aliases: Are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name
~~~sql
SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS Customer
FROM Customers;

SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS [Contact Person]
FROM Customers;

SELECT CustomerName, Address + ', ' + PostalCode + ' ' + City + ', ' + Country AS Address
FROM Customers;

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Customers, Orders
WHERE Customers.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID;

SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
WHERE c.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;
~~~

- Joins: Is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them
    - (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
    - LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
    - RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
    - FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
~~~sql
SELECT *
FROM Orders AS o
INNER JOIN Customers AS c
ON o.CustomerID=c.CustomerID;
~~~

- INNER JOIN: Selects records that have matching values in both tables
~~~sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
FROM ((Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);
~~~

- LEFT JOIN: 
    - Returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table (table2) 
    - The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match
~~~sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;

SELECT *
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
WHERE Orders.ShipperID is not null
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
~~~

- RIGHT JOIN:
    - Returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matching records from the left table (table1) 
    - The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match
~~~sql
SELECT Orders.EmployeeID ,Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Employees
ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
WHERE Orders.EmployeeID is not null
ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;
~~~

- FULL OUTER JOIN:
    - Returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records
~~~sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
~~~

- Self Join: Self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.
~~~sql
SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City
ORDER BY A.City;
~~~
